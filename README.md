# Waitr-Remove_Unavailable_Restaurants

If you live in a food desert and are tired of having half the Waitr results being populated with "Coming Soon" placards, and are frustrated about the inability to filter those out, then I have good news for you!

These userscripts will give those the boot, leaving you with only choices that you *can* have!

# Beginner Installation Instructions

Userscripts allow (as the name might suggest), users to allow their own scripts & content into websites they use. Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey are two script managers that allow you to use those userscripts on websites. Using Tampermonkey is preferred, as that supports the most platforms. 

- Go to http://www.tampermonkey.net/ and install the extension for your browser of choice.
- Once it is installed, go to the [Waitr Tampermonkey script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atlc/Waitr-Remove_Unavailable_Restaurants/master/Tampermonkey.js) and copy everything.
- Click on the Tampermonkey icon, which should've just appeared in your browser extensions, which should appear like one of these

- Click "Create a new script", paste the copied code into the editor making sure to **overwrite the default stuff that was previously there**, and save.
- Open Waitr or reload the page if you're already there, and revel in the new page that is free of clutter.
